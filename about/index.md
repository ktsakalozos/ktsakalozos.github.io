## Who's this?

Konstantinos currently finds it really difficult to explain to his little daughter what his exact job is. He would very much appreciate any advice on how to describe what a maintainer of a Kubernetes distribution maintainer is, in particular MicroK8s by Canonical. His past is even more impossible to describe. His daughter would probably need to sign some form of NDA before she hears what her dad was doing with big data over at Microsoft some years ago. Konstantinos wishes his PhD was on kid's education but unfortunately it was on "Resource allocation IaaS clouds", so that would not help either.
