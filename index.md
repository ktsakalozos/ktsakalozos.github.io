## What if this site did not exist...

I might have...

* spent my life understanding quantum mechanics and I would be about to make a substantial contribution to physics.
* gone into biology trying to save peoples lives. A nobel price would have been a mater of time.
* spent the time of building this site on learning how to fly a drone.
* preferred to learn some craft like wood curving, or
* ... simply, not ever existed.
